# Modal window (pop-up) component made with CSS, HTML &amp; JavaScript

## Project Objective

A Modal window, also known as a pop-up, is a component that can be used to display additional content or prompts on a web page. This particular modal component is made using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. It is designed to be triggered by a button or link on the page, and will appear as a window overlay on top of the existing content. The modal window will have a close button represented by an "X" icon, which the user can click to close the modal and return to the underlying page. The modal window is implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, HTML to create the structure of the modal, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality of the component.

## The user can also close the window in three ways:

1. Click X button
2. Click space outside modal window
3. Use ESC key
